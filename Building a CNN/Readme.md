## Image Recognition

**Problem Description:**<br>
We will create a Convolutional Neural Network that is able to detect various objects in images.<br> 
We will implement this Deep Learning model to recognize a cat or a dog in a set of pictures.<br>
This model can be tested with any dog/cat picture, including drawings.

A possibility for later testing would be to include in the training set images from comics/artwork/drawing, <br>
a labeled training set could be easily obtained from Google Images. <br>
I'll have to check this, and compare it's accuracy with the current model, it might be usefull for developing models<br>
where images are shown behind filters, courtains, plastic or any semitransparent surface, as training from drawins could<br>
allow for a general shape feature recognition.
