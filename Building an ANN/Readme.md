## Churn Modelling Problem

**Business Problem Description:**
This is data analytics challenge for a bank. A dataset with a large sample of the bank's customers is given. <br>
The gathered information contains customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, has a credit card, etc. <br>
The data corresponds to a period of 6 months, where the bank observed if these customers left or stayed in the bank. 
The goal is to make an Artificial Neural Network that can predict, based on geo-demographical and transactional information given above, if any individual customer will leave the bank or stay (customer churn). <br>
We are asked to rank all the customers of the bank, based on their probability of leaving. I'll use a Deep Learning model based on a probabilistic approach.
